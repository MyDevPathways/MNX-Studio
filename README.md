# MNX Studio - Simple Business Website

This is one of my first projects, created after learning HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. During this time, I also learned Bootstrap, which helped me build this mini-project.

The project is a simple business landing page created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**. The page represents a studio website featuring sections like home, about us, team, and contact. It is fully responsive, thanks to the Bootstrap framework, and uses custom styles for specific visual enhancements.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For custom styles, including layout, fonts, and media queries.
- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive design and pre-built components like navigation, cards, accordion, and form controls.
- **JavaScript**: Minimal JavaScript is used for the responsive navigation bar.
- **FontAwesome** and **Bootstrap Icons**: For icon usage across the webpage.
- **Google Fonts**: Roboto font family is used for typography.

## Sections and Features

1. **Navigation Bar**:

   - A fixed, responsive navbar that collapses on smaller screens.
   - Includes links to different sections: Home, About Us, Team, and Contact.

2. **Home Section**:

   - Features a full-screen background image with a heading and a button to navigate to the About Us section.
   - Includes a dark overlay using the `.hero-shadow` class to enhance text readability.

3. **About Us Section**:

   - Describes the studio’s core values such as Quality, Clients, Equipment, and Pricing.
   - Uses Bootstrap grid and cards for layout and organization.
   - Contains an accordion to highlight the studio’s unique selling points.

4. **Team Section**:

   - Introduces the team members with photos and descriptions.
   - The layout is structured using Bootstrap’s responsive grid system.

5. **Contact Section**:

   - Includes a contact form for users to submit inquiries.
   - Contact details (address, phone, and email) are displayed alongside the form.

6. **Footer**:
   - A simple footer with the studio’s name and a copyright notice.

## Custom Styles

- Custom styles are defined in the `style.css` file, including global styles for padding, margins, and font sizes.
- The site uses a color scheme focused on **orange** and **royal blue** for branding.

## Usage

You can open the `index.html` file in any browser to view the webpage locally. Ensure that you have an internet connection to load external assets like Bootstrap and FontAwesome icons.
